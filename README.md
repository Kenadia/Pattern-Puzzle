All code by Ken Schiller.

For demonstration purposes, the first two levels, which are boring, are skipped.

Gameplay:
Each level has a different set of patterns. Matching patterns by grouping blocks of the same size and color gives points, and getting enough points allows you to progress to the next level. There are three kinds of combos:
  - simultaneous combo: match multiple nonoverlapping patterns with a single move;
  - overlapping combo: match multiple overlapping patterns with a single move;
  - chain combo: match a pattern that results in blocks falling and forming more matches.
Blocks marked with an 'O' can form patterns normally but will not be removed unless they are part of an overlapping combo.

Controls:
  - mouse-over:           select row and column
  - w/s:                  shift selected column up/down
  - a/d:                  shift selected column left/right
  - q:                    toggle size of blocks in row
  - e:                    toggle size of blocks in column
  - i/j/k/l:              shift whole grid
